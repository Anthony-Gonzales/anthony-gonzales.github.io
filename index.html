									<h2 class="major">Cash Flow Project</h2>

									<p>For our senior project, my group and I created an application called <u>Cash Flow</u>.</p>

									<p>
										A lot of my coworkers look at their bank account, a few days after receiving their check 
										and exclaim out loud, “Where is all my money going?!” 
										Our research topic will revolve around applications that perform the task 
										of finance tracking and have an emphasis on spending tracking. 
										The importance of this topic is to help users budget better 
										and have a tool that will show them where their spending is going, 
										so that they can adjust said spending accordingly. 
									</p>

									<p>
										Our group had 12 user studies for the first prototype and another 12 for the second prototype.
										Between the two options, users preferred the prototype that allowed them to sign into their bank account
										via the application Plaid. We gave each user a 26 question form that provided feedback about the prototypes.
										Pictured below are a few of the questions and responses that we found to be most significant.
										Along from this questionnaire, we discovered that most of the users had not used similar finance
										or spending tracking applications.
										Our users also let us know that there is an equal interest in both saving money as well as tracking their expenditures.
									</p>

									<p>
										The improvement expected through our design is to try and clean up the interface 
										and overall usability of a finance tracking type of application. 
										Furthermore, in lieu of our application being a catch all for finance tools, 
										we want to focus on the spending tracking aspect of it. 
										We plan on having a visual tool to show you categories of where the user’s spending is going; 
										then if they want more detailed information (in terms of spending) for a specific category, 
										our application will break down their spending for each category.
